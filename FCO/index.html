        <h3>Overview</h3>
    </center>
    <p>
        Free Cities: Origins (FCO) is an HTML game developed using SugarCube 2 based on the famous Free Cities 
        HTML game by FCAuthor. While FreeCities was a management-centric game, we wanted to give an RPG 
        spin on it.<br><br>
        In FCO you are thrown into the world years after the fall of modern civilization. The Gregorian 
        calendar while still in use, has reset its year sometime in the past. You start as an unfortunate 
        soul who is enslaved by slave owner Shintani Hiroyuki, who, unbeknownst to him, is obsessed with 
        his Japanese heritage and seeks to rebuild the <em>civilizations</em> for the myths of old.
        <br><br>
        The game takes the player on a journey from slavehood to eventually the main character in a 
        power struggle between settlements and the last centralized power, the <em>Trade Union</em>. 
        From here, the player can align themselves with a particular faction, effecting the entire 
        game world. The world itself is dynamic and constantly changing, many of these changes are 
        completely unknown to the player until they receive higher status and thus intel. The world 
        also features a dynamic economy that operates on Supply-and-Demand, and simulated Brownian 
        motion.
        <br><br>
        The final phase of the game (in development) is to build a settlement from the ground up which 
        will be the first <em>Free City</em>. We plan to have complex diplomatic and economic actions 
        against other settlements, and of course, complex actions with player vassals and subjects.
